**Checklist** is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to sign up for an account, log in, and add tasks to their checklist. The tasks are sorted alphabetically and the user can mark them as complete and delete the tasks as they wish.

## Technology

The backend uses Node/Express with CRUD routes for the users' tasks. Authentication is handled with [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) using JWTs stored in HTTP Only cookies. The frontend is built with React.
